# song_track_removal

Created a simple script that removes the track number from song files
in a directory.  Takes the directory path where the song files are held
as as an argument.

Example:

    >>python remove_track_number.py “/Users/user_name/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Music/Gin Wigmore/Gravel And Wine”
    
Result:

01 Black Sheep.mp3 --> Black Sheep.mp3

(for Jamie xx):

03 SeeSaw (Featuring – Romy Madley Croft).mp3 --> SeeSaw.mp3
